                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData",
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {

            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

and click Review policy, provide a name for the IAM policy and click Create policy

Creating IAM Role

Next, We need to create an IAM Role and attach the IAM policy with it.

Click Roles and then choose Create role, For AWS Service, Choose EC2 and click Next: permissions


Click the Role and there you will find a Role ARN as shown below.

arn:aws:iam::00000000000:role/role_name
Copy the Role ARN and the click Trust relationships, Click Edit trust relationship, Under Principal after Service, Add the Role ARN as shown below.

"AWS": "arn:aws:iam::00000000000:role/role_name"

And click Update Trust Policy

                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::**************:role/grafana-cloudwatch-role"
            },
